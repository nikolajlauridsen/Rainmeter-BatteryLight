# Rainmeter-BatteryLight
Light themed battery indicator for rainmeter

Made to match the clock from [FLHUD](https://dd-921.deviantart.com/art/FLHUD-1-2-Final-711649169). Works out of the box if you set the coordinates of the clock to x: 80, y: 70, but you can always tweak the settings of BatteryLight in the BatteryLight.ini file.
